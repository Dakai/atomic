# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark scheme color designed for use with terminal and GUI applications (code editors). Atomic has a seventeen color palette: seven dark accent colors, seven light accent colors, two extra colors for auxiliar purposes and the background color. I designed this palette for people. Each color is easily differentiable from each other.

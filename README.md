# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use with terminal and several GUI applications (code editors). The color palette consists of sixteen colors selected with high precision: the hues are easily distinguishable for the human eye (between 30 degrees and 90 degrees of separation), and luminance is equilibrated (50% luminance for dark accent and 70% for light accent) which has been calculated following the ITU-R Recommendation BT.601.

Atomic also has a Zsh theme for your terminal.

# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use with terminal, Zsh and several GUI applications (code editors).

## Color palette

The color palette consists of sixteen precision colors selected procedurally (algorithms), distributed in six hues and four balanced luma. Luma is the perceived brightness, not the lightness of the HSL model.

Human eyes don't detect brightness linearly with color —we see red color brighter than blue color, and green color brighter than red color—, so the luma has been balanced following the ITU-R Recommendation BT.601:

`Y' = 0.299 R' + 0.587 G' + 0.114 B'`

In a RGB color wheel, hue angles have been calculated in order to be distinguishable for the human eye and keeping harmony: two analogous colors (0º and 30º), their complementary (180º and 210º) and tetrad (90º and 270º).

## Zsh theme

Atomic Zsh theme has been designed to show useful information (username, hostname and pwd) without taking the entire line. If a directory is under Git control, in the second line it shows the current branch and status. The top separator helps to visually separate every task and shows the current time.

## Editors and IDEs

- [x] Terminal
- [x] NetBeans IDE
- [x] Sublime Text

# Installation
## Terminal

Installation in KDE:

1. Copy the file `Atomic.colorscheme` to `~/.kde/share/apps/konsole/` directory (or `~/.local/share/konsole/` directory if your KDE version is 5 or higher).
2. Open your terminal: `Settings` > `Edit Current Profile` > `Appearance` and choose «Atomic».

## Zsh

Installation in Zsh:

1. Copy the file `honukai.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Change the theme name to `ZSH_THEME="atomic"` in the file `~/.zshrc`.
3. Reload Zsh with `source ~/.zshrc`.

## Tmux

Installation in Tmux:

1. The file `.tmux.conf` has two sections: the theme and the scheme color.
2. Copy the sections you are interested in and paste them to your `~/.tmux.conf` file.
3. Reload the new config using the command `Ctrl+a r`.
4. Make sure you have the Powerline fonts installed. (Status bar uses the Powerline look).

## Cmus

Installation in cmus:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file and manually place `atomic.theme` file into `~/.cmus/`.
2. Open your cmus and type: `:colorscheme atomic`. Enjoy!

## Irssi

Installation in irssi:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file and manually place `atomic.theme` file into `~/.irssi/`.
2. Open your irssi and type: `/set theme atomic`. You can save changes with `/save`.

## Sublime Text

Atomic scheme color for Sublime Text has its own repository, so it allows the installation through Package Control.

1. Make sure you already have Package Control installed.
2. Choose `Install Package` from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X).
3. Select Atomic in the menu: `Preferences` > `Atomic` > `Atomic`.

More info at: [https://github.com/gerardbm/Sublime-Atomic-Scheme](https://github.com/gerardbm/Sublime-Atomic-Scheme)

With `auto_upgrade` enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

## NetBeans

Installation in NetBeans IDE:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file (`atomic-master.zip`) and then manually create a new zip file containing the folder `config`. In bash:
```bash
zip -r atomic.zip config
```
2. Open your NetBeans: `Tools` > `Options` > `Import...` > `Browse...`. Navigate to the zip file you created in the previous step. Make sure the option `Fonts & Colors` is checked and press `Ok` button.
3. Restart your NetBeans.
4. To switch between color schemes, in the `Options` panel go to the `Fonts & Colors` tab and choose a profile (in our case, 'Atomic').

**Known Issues**

If you are [still] using Windows XP, do not use the archive program built-in to create the zip file (step 1). It does not support file paths longer than a certain length. Use a third party archiver like 7zip, which is free.

## Font family

The default font is DejaVu Sans Mono from the [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org) fonts family (under a [Free license](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License)). Anyway, Atomic is designed to look good with any kind of typography, as colors are distinguishable to any thickness.

Some themes (tmux) require the installation of Powerline fonts.

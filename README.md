# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use with terminal and several GUI applications (code editors). Color palette consists of sixteen colors for text (selected with high precision: tones easily differenciable for the human eye and luminance equilibrated, which has been calculated following the ITU-R Recommendation BT.601) and the background color.

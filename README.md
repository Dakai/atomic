# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use with terminal, Vim/Neovim and several GUI code editors. This repository also includes themes for some terminal applications (tmux, irssi, cmus...) and Zsh.

### Color palette

The color palette consists of sixteen precision colors selected procedurally (algorithms), distributed in six hues and four balanced Luma (Y'). Note that Luma (Y') is the perceived brightness; don't confuse it with the lightness of the HSL color model.

Human vision doesn't detect brightness linearly with color: in a pixel (R'G'B'), we see red color (255, 0, 0) brighter than blue color (0, 0, 255), and green color (0, 255, 0) brighter than red color (255, 0, 0). So, in order to balance the color contrast, the perceived brightness has been corrected according to the ITU-R Recommendation BT.601:

`Luma (Y') = 0.299 R' + 0.587 G' + 0.114 B'`

This algorithm is also [suggested by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast), however it's still open to change.

In a RGB color wheel, hues have been selected in order to be distinguishable for the human eye and keeping harmony: two analogous colors (0º and 30º), their complementary (180º and 210º) and tetrad (90º and 270º).

**Night mode**

In the previous palette, hue of **base colors** (1, 8, 9 and 16) is 210º, so colors have more blue and green than red. During the day, these colors don't carry any problem, but at night blue light negatively affects health and sleep patterns: it affects levels of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin more than any other wavelength.

In the following color palette, hue of base colors is 30º instead of 210º (actually, it's the complementary hue). That means values of blue and green colors have been reduced inversely, while value of red color has been increased in the same proportion.

## Installation

### Terminal

Installation for **konsole**:

1. Copy the file `Atomic.colorscheme` to `~/.kde/share/apps/konsole/` directory (or `~/.local/share/konsole/` directory if your KDE version is 5 or higher).
2. Open your terminal: `Settings` > `Edit Current Profile` > `Appearance` and choose «Atomic».

Installation for **gnome-terminal**:

1. Download the script `install-atomic.sh`.
2. Assign it execution permissions: `chmod +x install-atomic.sh`.
3. Open your terminal and execute the script: `./install-atomic.sh`.

Installation for **xfce4-terminal**:

1. Copy the file `terminalrc` to your `~/.config/xfce4/terminal/` directory or paste its content into it if you already have this file.

Installation for **URxvt**:

1. Copy the content of the file `Xresources.dark` or `Xresources.night` to your `.Xresources` file.
2. Load the resource file with the command: `xrdb ~/.Xresources`.

You will find more information on the .Xresources file in the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_resources).

### Vim

Installation in Vim/Neovim:

1. Copy the file `atomic.vim` contained into the `vim` directory of this repository and paste it into `~/.vim/colors/` (Vim) or `~/.config/nvim/colors/` (Neovim).
2. Set the colorscheme in your Vim/Neovim configuration file: `colorscheme atomic`.
3. If you are in a GUI for Vim (as gvim), you have commands to switch between dark and night mode:
	- `AtomicDark`: sets the dark mode (default).
	- `AtomicNight`: sets the night mode.

Or switch them depending on the current time. In your `.gvimrc`:

```viml
function! AtomicSwitcher()
	if (strftime("%H") > 8) && (strftime("%H") < 20)
		AtomicDark
	else
		AtomicNight
	endif
endfunction
```

### NetBeans

Installation in NetBeans:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file (`atomic-master.zip`) and then manually create a new zip file containing the folder `config`. In bash:
```bash
zip -r atomic.zip config
```
2. Open your NetBeans: `Tools` > `Options` > `Import...` > `Browse...`. Navigate to the zip file you created in the previous step. Make sure the option `Fonts & Colors` is checked and press `Ok` button.
3. Restart your NetBeans.
4. To switch between color schemes, in the `Options` panel go to the `Fonts & Colors` tab and choose a profile (in our case, 'Atomic').

**Known Issues**

If you are [still] using Windows XP, do not use the archive program built-in to create the zip file (step 1). It does not support file paths longer than a certain length. Use a third party archiver like 7zip, which is free.

### Sublime Text

Atomic scheme color for Sublime Text has its own repository, so it allows the installation through Package Control.

1. Make sure you already have Package Control installed.
2. Choose `Install Package` from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X).
3. Select Atomic in the menu: `Preferences` > `Atomic` > `Atomic`.

More info at: [https://github.com/gerardbm/Sublime-Atomic-Scheme](https://github.com/gerardbm/Sublime-Atomic-Scheme)

With `auto_upgrade` enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

### Zsh

Atomic Zsh theme has been designed to show useful information (username, hostname and pwd) without taking the entire line. If a directory is under Git control, in the second line it shows the current branch and status. Top separator helps to visually separate every task and shows the current time.

Installation in Zsh:

1. Copy the file `atomic.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Change the theme name to `ZSH_THEME="atomic"` in the file `~/.zshrc`.
3. Reload Zsh with `source ~/.zshrc`.

### Tmux

This config file has two sections: key bindings and status bar design. Most of the key bindings have double navigation, using arrow keys and using Vim keys (hjkl). It fits perfectly in a workflow with vim. Status displays system information (hostname, session, time and date), very useful for working in fullscreen mode.

Installation in Tmux:

1. The file `.tmux.conf` has two sections: the theme and the scheme color.
2. Copy the sections you are interested in and paste them to your `~/.tmux.conf` file.
3. Reload the new config using the command `Ctrl+a r`.
4. Make sure you have the Powerline fonts installed. (Status bar uses the Powerline look).

### Vim-airline

It's a vim-airline theme using Atomic colors and it's vailable for Terminal and Gvim.

Installation in Vim:

1. Install the plugin [vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) in your Vim.
2. Copy the file `atomic.vim` to your 'vim-airline-themes' directory: `../vim-airline-themes/autoload/airline/themes/`.
3. Add the following settings to your `.vimrc`.
4. And finally type: `:AirlineTheme atomic`.
```viml
" Use 'atomic' by default
let g:airline_theme='atomic'
" Enable it if you use the Powerline fonts
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
" Enable a tabs line at the top
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
" It disables bold text, so it looks like tmux status bar
call airline#parts#define_accent('mode', 'black')
```
Also, make sure you have the Powerline fonts installed, like in Tmux.

### Cmus

Simply, it's a theme using Atomic colors. Cmus themes don't allow other configurations.

Installation in cmus:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file and manually place `atomic.theme` file into `~/.cmus/`.
2. Open your cmus and type: `:colorscheme atomic`. Enjoy!

### Irssi

This theme has been created to make the reading easier and more intuitive.

Installation in irssi:

1. Download the Atomic repository, unpack the downloaded file and manually place `atomic.theme` file into `~/.irssi/`.
2. Open your irssi and type: `/set theme atomic`. You can save changes with `/save`.

## Font family

The default font family is **DejaVu Sans Mono** from the [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org) fonts family (under a [Free license](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License)). Anyway, Atomic is designed to look good with any kind of typography, as colors are distinguishable to any thickness.

Some themes (tmux and vim-airline) require the installation of Powerline fonts.
